---

We are *Aventures Sonores*, a creative collective group that blends art and technology to make physical and digital (phygital) experiential adventures. We strongly believe that listening is not only a way to receive and decode information, but mediates all of our relationships: with others, with the environment, with society in general, and even with ourselves.

Our Latin American roots and global upbringing inform a strong belief that the interrelation between people, arts, nature, and technology can provide the content, and the means, to create a global, borderless aural community. In this community, each participant is no longer a simple spectator, but an actual co-creator of sound, music, and sonic wisdom.
