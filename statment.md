## xVision

***Aventures Sonores*** is an aural community, a meeting point, a phygital space where the borders between the physical and digital are diffuse, and the aural dimension is the unifying component.

## xMission

Design and develop an *xTraterrestrial Tool to raise the pillars of the Playground for the Aural Community, in xJams of interplanetary sounds. 

Unearthing, connecting and hybridizing disciplines like music, sound art and poetry, empower incredible artists who dare to take on new values.
Make collaborative works of art, making traceability transparent in co-creation.
The infinite growth in Spaceship Earth is unsustainable, this is how we began a path to be increasingly aware and use technological tools as the mediating element in this community.
